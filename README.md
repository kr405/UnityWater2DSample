# URP Water2D
This project is a 2D water sample using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP).<br>
It has been tested on Unity 2022.3.17f1 and URP 14.0.9.

Interactive ripples can be generated around objects touching the water surface.<br>
Water reflection, caustics, and other water properties can be adjusted in the Inspector.

# Note
The appearance of the water heavily depends on the UV coordinates of the water sprite. For best results, use a simple sprite shape.
