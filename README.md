# URP Water2D Sample
This project is a 2D water sample using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
It has been tested on Unity 2022.3.17f and URP 14.0.9.

# Demo
You can customize the water's reflection and caustics settings.
Interactive ripples can be generated around objects touching the water surface.

Note: The appearance of the water heavily depends on the UV coordinates of the water sprite. For best results, use a simple sprite shape.
